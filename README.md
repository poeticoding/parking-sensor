# ESP32 Parking Sensor

A visual parking assistance system using ESP32, ultrasonic sensor, and LED strip to help navigate tight garage spaces.

## Problem

My garage is barely big enough for my car (4.7m car in 4.8m garage space). Standard parking sensors just beep without showing exact distance, making precise positioning nearly impossible.

## Solution

LED strip that provides real-time visual feedback:
- ðŸŸ¢ **Green**: Safe distance (>200cm)
- âšª **White**: Getting closer (10-200cm) 
- ðŸ”´ **Red**: Danger zone (â‰¤5-10cm)

LEDs illuminate from both ends toward center, creating an intuitive progress bar effect.

## Hardware

- **ESP32**: UM FeatherS3 (any ESP32 works)
- **Distance Sensor**: HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor
- **LED Strip**: 1m WS2812B RGB strip (60 LEDs)
- **Power**: 12V adapter + buck converter to 5V
- **Wiring**: 18AWG for power distribution
